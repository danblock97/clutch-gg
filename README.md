# ClutchGG.LOL v1.13.3

## Overview
This update is all about refining your gaming experience by squashing some pesky bugs and polishing key features. We’ve focused on making gameplay clearer and more consistent, especially in Arena and non-Arena modes.

## Bug Fixes

  No more ambiguous "Victory" or "Defeat" messages. Now, Arena mode accurately displays your actual placement so you always know exactly where you stand.
