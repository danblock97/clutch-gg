# ClutchGG.LOL v1.13.2

## Tag Logic Makeover
We've reimagined the way standout performances are celebrated. The MVP tag now demands even more brilliance, ensuring only the most exceptional plays earn that coveted title. And if your team falls short? No worries—our new **Ace** tag recognizes the best player on the losing side, proving that even in defeat, individual genius shines through.

## Asset Patch Overhaul
Our assets just got a facelift! By updating our asset patch to the latest version, every icon and visual detail is now sharper and more up-to-date, enhancing the overall aesthetic and gameplay experience.

## Bug Exterminations
- **Tooltip Tamer:** No more wandering tooltips. They've been corralled to stay right where you need them.
- **Arena Mode Polish:** The Live Game component in Arena Mode has been fine-tuned for a smoother, more immersive experience.

Thank you for using ClutchGG.LOL—where every match is a chance to redefine excellence!
